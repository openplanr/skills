# Changelog

All notable changes to `openplanr-skills` are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.26.0] — 2026-08-04

### Changed

- The `planr-sync`, `planr-ship`, `planr-design`, and `planr-dashboard` skills no
  longer carry their own copy of the workflow procedure. Each now names the one
  procedure file its pipeline counterpart reads, generalizing the delegation
  `planr-plan` already used. The procedure text existed twice — once here and once
  in the pipeline — so every change had to land in both places, and the second
  landing is the one that gets forgotten.
- `scripts/validate.mjs` — the byte-parity check that previously covered a single
  skill now loops over all six workflow skills, comparing each against its
  canonical pipeline counterpart. Two differences are tolerated and only two: the
  `license: MIT` frontmatter line, and the runtime-neutral `--runtime
  <active-runtime>` placeholder that replaces the pipeline copy's Codex-specific
  `--runtime codex`. Any other differing byte fails and names the skill.
- A new guard asserts the mirrored skills never hard-code a literal runtime name
  in a `--runtime` argument. The parity tolerance above is applied to both sides,
  so a literal that leaked into this bundle would otherwise normalize away and
  pass — while shipping a Codex-only instruction to Claude Code and Cursor users.
  The check reads each skill unconditionally, so it still fires when no pipeline
  checkout is present. `planr-operate` is exempt: it is deliberately
  runtime-differentiated.
- Pinned to `planr-pipeline@0.40.0` across `package.json`, both CI workflow refs,
  and the implementation note.

## [1.25.0] — 2026-08-03

### Added

- `planr-doctor` now drives an OpenPlanr upgrade, not only diagnoses drift. When
  the installed tuple has drifted, the skill runs the CLI's own upgrade flow,
  executes the plugin-half commands the CLI prescribes — refreshing the plugin
  marketplace first, so the installer cannot reinstall the cached, stale version
  — then re-checks and reports the real before/after difference in installed
  versions rather than an assumed one. The command list is read from the CLI's
  output, never written into the skill, so it can never drift from what an
  install would actually run. A new `references/upgrade.md` walkthrough documents
  the output shape and the reporting format.

### Changed

- The plugin marketplace entry now declares `strict: true` and pins every skill
  that ships today, including the planning skill, so the host loader reports no
  conflicting-manifest error and no skill in a user's current bundle disappears
  on upgrade. `scripts/validate.mjs` now models two skill classes — portable
  workflow skills, held to the runtime-neutral leak check, and the shipped
  planning skill, permitted to document per-runtime routing as its subject
  matter — and fails if a new skill directory would auto-ship into neither class
  unnoticed.

## [1.24.0] — 2026-08-02

### Changed

- Re-mirror the generated `planr-operate` skill from `planr-pipeline` 0.39.0.
  The regenerated instructions now record each advisor result the instant that
  role returns — one role at a time against the shared session, never batched
  behind the whole board — so a slow lens can no longer strand a finished one.
  A still-running role renews its session with the `harness heartbeat` action
  instead of letting the lease expire. The advisor procedure states that a
  result is recorded the instant the role returns, independent of any sibling,
  and that a retry replays identical bytes for the same role and idempotency
  key.
- The workflow gains no engine logic: lease, retry, and heartbeat bookkeeping
  stay in the engine; the skill only dispatches native agents and invokes the
  CLI-returned harness actions.
- Declare `planr-pipeline@0.39.0` compatibility in `package.json`, validate it
  in `npm test`, and validate byte parity against `planr-pipeline` `v0.39.0`
  in CI (was `v0.37.1`).

## [1.22.0] — 2026-08-01

### Changed

- Re-mirror the Protocol v1.3 mandate-only `planr-operate` workflow from
  `planr-pipeline` 0.36.1. Runtime agents now investigate through bounded
  read-only native tools and return citation-bearing responses; the skill no
  longer advertises legacy role packs, mission packets, collector budgets,
  source/file-import controls, evidence classification, or dispatch overrides.
- Validate byte parity against `planr-pipeline` `v0.36.1` and fail when a
  retired Operating Board surface returns to the generated workflow.

## [1.21.0] — 2026-08-01

### Changed

- Re-mirror the generated `planr-operate` skill from the pipeline's 0.35.0
  runtime assets, so the public skill matches the release that enforces
  mission-packet evidence caps and adds the `create-epic` route kind.
- Validate against `planr-pipeline` `v0.35.0` in CI (was `v0.34.0`), keeping
  the byte-for-byte mirror check aligned with the published contracts.

## [1.20.0] — 2026-07-31

### Changed

- Re-mirror the generated `planr-operate` skill from the pipeline's 0.34.0
  runtime assets: the skill gains the mission branch (dispatch the named
  `operating-<role>` subagent with only its mission packet and bounded
  read-only tool grant, and record the v1.3 citation-bearing response),
  alongside the preserved pack path, plus the exit-4-is-handoff rule so
  healthy guided continuations stop rendering as failures.
- Validate against `planr-pipeline` `v0.34.0` in CI (was `v0.33.1`), so the
  byte-for-byte mirror check tracks the field-fix contract release.

## [1.19.0] — 2026-07-31

### Changed

- Re-mirror the generated `planr-operate` skill from the pipeline's 0.33.1
  runtime assets: the skill now explicitly owns the end-to-end interactive
  workflow, orchestrating the adapter `prepare → record → finalize`
  lifecycle invisibly, and cadence-triggered runs remain review-only (no
  auto-chain to PLAN or SHIP, no accepting findings or applying routes).
- Validate against `planr-pipeline` `v0.33.1` in CI (was `v0.32.1`), so the
  byte-for-byte mirror check tracks the Protocol v1.3 agentic-execution
  release.

## [1.18.2] — 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- Add the canonical `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest so Claude Code
  registers the bundle as `openplanr@openplanr` instead of exposing
  version-prefixed command namespaces such as `1.18.1:planr-operate`.
- Align installation guidance with the official `openplanr/marketplace`
  distribution channel used by managed `planr setup` updates.

## [1.18.1] — 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- A bare `planr-operate` invocation now runs the complete native Operating
  Board cycle and stops at its human review gate; users no longer need to write
  the orchestration prompt or relay adapter commands.
- Initialization runs only when inspection reports it missing. Guided fallback
  prefers native questions or Planr's attached terminal and asks at most one
  structured chat question at a time.
- Runtime guidance aligns with `planr-pipeline@0.32.1` and
  `openplanr@1.16.1`.

## [1.18.0] — 2026-07-30

### Changed

- `planr-operate` now completes bounded native advisor handoffs inside Claude
  Code, Codex, and Cursor instead of asking users to manually shuttle lifecycle
  commands between the CLI and runtime.
- Operating cycles surface cited Markdown/JSON briefs and exact governed
  conversions into specs, stories, tasks, quick tasks, gaps, decisions, and
  owner actions while preserving the separate PLAN and SHIP gates.
- Evidence-safety recovery follows Planr's value-free quarantine and
  classification flow so one unsafe evidence item does not block unrelated
  advisory lenses.
- Runtime guidance and byte-parity validation now target
  `planr-pipeline@0.32.0` and the `openplanr@1.16.0` Operating Board contract.

## [1.17.2] — 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- Use an explicit Node test entrypoint instead of a POSIX shell glob so the
  standalone suite runs under PowerShell and does not discover sibling
  ecosystem-fixture tests.

## [1.17.1] — 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- Pin the generated `planr-operate` skill to LF line endings so Windows clones
  preserve byte identity with the canonical pipeline asset.

## [1.17.0] — 2026-07-29

### Changed

- `planr-operate` now presents CLI-owned guided questions through native
  runtime capabilities, transports typed answers through resumable sessions,
  and stops separately at every digest-bound non-read-only action.
- Evidence quarantine recovery uses only the public value-free
  `planr operate evidence diagnose/classify` flow; skills never trial-edit
  operating configuration or weaken secret detection.
- Validation now enforces byte parity with the generated pipeline asset and
  rejects copied question wording, inferred `--yes`, nested pipeline commands,
  and unsafe state-edit instructions.

## [1.16.0] — 2026-07-28

### Added

- `planr-operate`, a thin cross-runtime workflow for evidence-backed operating
  cycles through the public `planr operate` command.

### Changed

- Unified guidance now preserves separate preview, cycle, acceptance, route,
  PLAN review, and SHIP boundaries for Operating Board work.
- Runtime instructions align with `openplanr@1.14.0`,
  `planr-pipeline@0.30.0`, and Protocol v1.2 operating capabilities.

## [1.15.0] — 2026-07-16

### Changed

- `planr-artifact` now uses encrypted live collaboration rooms by default,
  documents creator-only management controls, and retains immutable sharing
  behind the explicit `--snapshot` option.
- Runtime instructions align with `openplanr@1.12.0` and
  `planr-pipeline@0.28.0`.

## [1.14.0] — 2026-07-15

### Changed

- `planr-artifact` now explains the default headless document presentation,
  explicit canvas override, resolved JSON output, and the distinction between
  private artifact review and standalone website hosting.
- Runtime instructions align with `openplanr@1.11.0` and
  `planr-pipeline@0.27.1`.

## [1.13.0] — 2026-07-15

### Added

- `planr-artifact` for local HTML review, explicit private sharing, returned-review
  import, and live-session export through `planr artifact`.

### Changed

- PLAN, Design, and SHIP skills now use the public deterministic `planr pipeline`
  engine routes and never require `planr-pipeline` on `PATH`.
- Documentation now matches `openplanr@1.10.0`, `planr-pipeline@0.26.3`, and the
  deployed `share.openplanr.dev` privacy model.

## [1.12.0] — 2026-07-12

### Added

- Portable PLAN, Design, SHIP, dashboard, sync, and doctor skills.
- Unified routing that distinguishes dedicated OpenPlanr planning from the
  pipeline's complete delivery flow and feature-local PO planning.
- CI validation for skill paths, names, and runtime-specific instruction leaks.

### Changed

- Codex skills and Cursor rules are first-class adapter surfaces rather than a
  large `AGENTS.md` persona workflow.

## [1.11.0] — 2026-06-17

### Changed — Aligned with `planr-pipeline` v0.23.0–v0.24.0

- Routes the new `/planr-pipeline:sync` command (v0.23.0+): reconciles spec ↔ quick-task ↔ tracker so every unit of work has its quick task — the externalization unit — then pushes those to Linear or GitHub for PO / manager visibility. Read-only and native-first by default (audit + local file fixes); the tracker push is explicit. Teaches that this is distinct from the CLI's `planr spec sync` (local integrity check), which it does NOT replace.
- Notes the v0.24.0 collaborative review board: `/planr-pipeline:design-review` now serves a persistent, multi-author feedback surface — contributions are attributed and merged without loss, survive refresh / close / re-serve, and show live presence over SSE.

### Pairs with

- `planr-pipeline` v0.23.0 — `/sync` spec ↔ quick-task ↔ tracker reconciliation
- `planr-pipeline` v0.24.0 — persistent, multi-author collaborative `/design-review` board

## [1.10.0] — 2026-06-14

### Changed — Aligned with `planr-pipeline` v0.21.0

- Routes the new `/planr-pipeline:dashboard` command (v0.21.0+): a persistent localhost server with six live, read-only views of `.planr/` — Overview · Graph · Board · List · Sprints · Activity — kept in sync as files change (≤1s, view-state preserved). Teaches when to reach for the visual dashboard versus the `/planr-pipeline:status` (terminal / markdown) delivery report.

### Pairs with

- `planr-pipeline` v0.21.0 — `/dashboard` live read-only project dashboard

## [1.9.0] — 2026-06-10

### Changed — Aligned with `planr-pipeline` v0.19.0

- Routes `/planr-pipeline:design-loop <target>` (brand-asset exploration on a live pin-comment board with taste memory; key-optional) and `/planr-pipeline:design-review <slug>` (pin-driven per-screen fixes on an existing generated design, with artifact sync). Both R1-stop.

### Pairs with

- `planr-pipeline` v0.19.0 — the Design Loop Engine + design-review

## [1.8.0] — 2026-06-07

### Changed — Aligned with `planr-pipeline` v0.14.0

- Teaches that `/planr-pipeline:design <slug>` works even when **no spec exists** yet: it asks whether to scaffold a spec or **explore standalone** (design only, into `.planr/designs/<slug>/`, no tracked spec) — so a design can be prototyped without committing to a spec first.

### Pairs with

- `planr-pipeline` v0.14.0 — `/design` no-spec ask + standalone exploration

## [1.7.0] — 2026-06-07

### Changed — Aligned with `planr-pipeline` v0.13.0

- Routing now teaches the optional `/planr-pipeline:design <slug>` step that runs **before** `/plan`: when a feature is UI-facing but has no PNG mockups, generate a visual design (prototype / walkthrough / canvas) + `design-spec.md` instead of shipping backend-only.
- Notes the R2 amendment (a `design-spec.md` OR a PNG ⇒ a UI task) so the design→UI-task loop is explained.

### Pairs with

- `planr-pipeline` v0.13.0 — `/planr-pipeline:design` generation (SPEC-015), Claude Code only

## [1.6.0] — 2026-05-11

### Changed — Aligned with `planr-pipeline` v0.9.0

- Task frontmatter template adds `rationale:` field (1-3 sentence decomposition reasoning)
- New "Project memory" section: `.planr/memory.md` with decisions, traps, corrections — append-only, keyword-matched into agent dispatch context
- New "Clarification loop" section: specification-agent emits structured options on ambiguity, PO resolves before re-running `/plan`
- New "Task rationale" section: qa-agent checks implementation drift vs stated rationale

### Pairs with

- `planr-pipeline` v0.9.0 — project memory, rationale, clarification loop, R10 build-order rule
- `openplanr` CLI v1.7.0 — artifact integrity, managed-block markers, adapter template alignment

## [1.5.0] — 2026-05-05

### Changed — Aligned with `planr-pipeline` v0.8.0

`skills/openplanr/SKILL.md` now teaches the v0.8.0 task lifecycle:

- Status enum widened to `pending | in-progress | done | blocked` (was `pending | in-progress | done`). Aligns with the pipeline's task schema and the new error-report companion files.
- New "Cross-runtime resume via task `status`" section documents the four-way status partition the pipeline uses on `/ship` entry, plus the `DISPATCH_MODE` default per runtime (Cursor/Codex `per-task`, Claude Code `multi-task`).

### Pairs with

- `planr-pipeline` v0.8.0 — schema discipline, mode isolation, run manifest, per-task error reports, dispatch state machine
- `openplanr` (planr CLI) v1.5.3 — `TaskStatus` widened to include `'blocked'` so Linear sync no longer demotes blocked tasks

## [1.4.0] — 2026-04-30

### Changed — Aligned with `planr-pipeline` rename

`skills/openplanr/SKILL.md` routing tree updated: install commands, slash commands, and generated rule filenames now reference `planr-pipeline` (was `openplanr-pipeline`). No behavioural change in the skill's logic — pure text/identifier alignment with the upstream plugin rename.

### Pairs with

- `planr-pipeline` v0.7.0 — Claude Code plugin (renamed from `openplanr-pipeline` v0.6.0; brand convergence on the `planr` CLI binary)
- `openplanr` (planr CLI) v1.5.1 — generated rule filenames + slash command references updated

## [1.3.0] — 2026-04-29

### Changed — Routing tree extended to multi-runtime

`skills/openplanr/SKILL.md` Critical Routing Decision is now a two-axis tree (runtime × pipeline-installed). New paths:

- **Path A** (Claude Code + openplanr-pipeline plugin) — canonical, manifest-enforced subagents
- **Path A2** (Cursor + planr-generated `.cursor/rules/openplanr-pipeline.mdc`) — Composer subagent dispatch
- **Path A3** (Codex + planr-generated AGENTS.md pipeline section) — persona role-shift
- **Path B** (Claude Code without pipeline plugin) — drive planr CLI, implement in-session
- **Path C** (bare CLI) — out of skill scope

When a runtime is detected without pipeline rules, the skill now suggests the appropriate `planr rules generate --target <runtime> --scope pipeline` command instead of falling back to Path B blindly.

### Pairs with

- `openplanr-pipeline` v0.6.0 — protocol docs + compatibility matrix + Cursor/Codex parity
- `OpenPlanr` (planr CLI) v1.5.0 — `--scope pipeline` flag on `rules generate`

### Files updated

- `skills/openplanr/SKILL.md`
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-27

### Changed — Routing logic for the four-component ecosystem

`skills/openplanr/SKILL.md` now teaches Claude an explicit decision tree:

- **Path A (openplanr-pipeline plugin installed):** invoke `/openplanr-pipeline:plan {slug}` then `/openplanr-pipeline:ship {slug}`. The pipeline auto-scaffolds its own spec shell. planr CLI commands are optional maintenance helpers, not prerequisites.
- **Path B (no pipeline plugin):** drive `planr spec ...` commands on the user's behalf, then implement tasks in-session.
- **Path C (bare CLI):** the user runs commands themselves; skill is not in the loop.

### Added

- Frontmatter schema reference inline in the skill (matches `OpenPlanr/docs/reference/spec-schema.md` v1.0.0)
- `planr init --yes` guidance — auto-detects API keys from OS keychain or env vars
- "Spec-driven commands" reference table mapping each command to which path it belongs in

### Files updated

- `skills/openplanr/SKILL.md`
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
- `CHANGELOG.md` (new)

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-25

Initial release with spec-driven mode awareness.
