# Planr Doctor

Run `planr doctor` with the requested flags. Prefer `--json` for diagnosis.
Preview every repair; package installation, version changes, provenance recovery,
and deletion always require explicit confirmation.

## Driving an upgrade

`planr` owns only half of an OpenPlanr upgrade — the npm CLI. The other half, the
host plugins, cannot be installed by a CLI; it needs a tool with host shell
access. That is this skill's job: drive the plugin half, then report what
actually changed — never what was merely attempted.

1. **Decide.** Run `planr upgrade status --json` and read `status`. If it is
   `aligned` or `unknown`, there is nothing to drive — report it and stop.
   Record the reported `installed` versions; that is the before state.
2. **Own half, prescribe half.** If `status` is `upgrade-available` or
   `incompatible`, confirm with the user (this upgrades the npm CLI), then run
   `planr upgrade apply --yes --json`. The CLI performs the npm half itself and
   returns the plugin half as an ordered `pluginHalfCommands` array — the exact
   argv it would run, so the list can never drift from the engine. Take the
   commands from there; never write a plugin command of your own.
3. **Refresh first, then execute in order.** Run every entry of
   `pluginHalfCommands` verbatim, in the array's given order, with your shell.
   The first entry is a marketplace refresh and must run first: skip it and the
   installer reinstalls the cached, stale version while the user believes they
   upgraded. Do not reorder, drop, or substitute an entry.
4. **Verify and report the real diff.** Re-run `planr upgrade status --json` and
   compare its `installed` versions against the before state. Report only what
   actually moved and to what. If a component did not move, say so — never claim
   "upgraded" for a version that did not change.

Longer walkthrough, the JSON output shape, and the reporting format live in
`references/upgrade.md`.
